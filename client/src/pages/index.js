          Get ready to dive into the world of Web3 and battle it out for
          ultimate dominance in this thrilling new video game! As a player,
          you'll face off against some of the toughest opponents the Web3 has to
          offer, using your wits, strategy, and a little bit of luck to emerge
          victorious.

          With each NPC opponent you face, you'll need to carefully study their
          play patterns and learn their strengths and weaknesses in order to
          defeat them. But don't get too comfortable - the Web3 is constantly
          evolving, and you'll need to stay on your toes if you want to come out
          on top. Whether you prefer to use brute force or cunning tactics, this
          game has something for everyone.{' '}

          Accessor Labsâ€™ ZK-ML tooling empowers game creators to enrich their
