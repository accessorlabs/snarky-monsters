# Snarky Monsters
On-chain turn-based combat game between zksnarked server and client.
- Randomness is verifiably generated between player and NPC using commitment schemes.
- A proof is generated for the entire battle.
- We posted the proofs to the Scroll Alphanet for the 2023 EthGlobal Scaling Ethereum hackathon.

You can see a demo [here](https://youtu.be/r9OE89WkCuE?t=742).
