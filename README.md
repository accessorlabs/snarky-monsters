# Snarky Monsters!
On-chain turn-based combat game between ZK-SNARKed server and client.
- Randomness is verifiably generated between player and NPC using commitment schemes.
- NPC logic (or as we like to call it, the NPC's internal psychology and biology) is hidden, allowing for a sweet hidden information mechanic. But the NPC verifiably follows the rules of the game.
- A proof is generated for the entire battle.
- We posted the proofs to the Scroll Alphanet for the 2023 EthGlobal Scaling Ethereum hackathon.

You can see a demo [here](https://youtu.be/r9OE89WkCuE?t=742).

Hope you enjoy!

## Ideas for next steps

It would be cool to:
- Create an NPC market that anyone could permissionlessly write to, creating their own NPCs with hidden move logic.
- Decentralise battle servers so that anyone can create proofs.
- Incorporate NFT rewards for players who make outstanding achievements.
